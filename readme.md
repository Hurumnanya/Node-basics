# ANSWERS TO QUESTION ONE.

# A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns 
# together. To make a change to this sort of application requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base and
# building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface. This makes updates restrictive and time-consuming. 

# ANSWERS TO QUESTION TWO.

# A microservices architecture, also simply known as microservices, is an architectural method that relies on a series of
# independently deployable services. These services have their own business logic and database with a specific goal. Updating, 
# testing, deployment, and scaling occur within each service. Microservices decouple major business, domain-specific concerns into 
# separate, independent code bases. Microservices donâ€™t reduce complexity, but they make any complexity visible and more manageable 
# by separating tasks into smaller processes that function independently of each other and contribute to the overall whole. 

# ANSWERS TO QUESTION THREE.
# Micro-service appeals to me more because of the ease it provides while handling bulky task, and also the ease of detecting and 
# fixing a bug.

# ANSWERS TO QUESTION FOUR.

# YES Node.js is a multithreaded langauage.

# ANSWERS TO QUESTION FIVE.
# REPL - stands for  Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop.
